## Online Learning Education current scenario
- People want to become an expert on new topic quickly, but no easy and compelling way exists.
- Online learning success rates are very low.
- Discover, curate and navigate open materials is a challenge.

A solution approach is a self-sustaining community broadening access to knowledge with a best of class learning paths curating open resources from the web. But this is not enough and SyllabusWeave adds an holistic, human, and helpful role with mentors.
